# Rain-Prediction
Predict future rain from past data using diffrent ml techniques like:- 
1. Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM
   
After predicting them, we calculate their accuracy using various evaluation metrics like:
1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
